A collection of experiments stemming from a larger research project
investigating speculative interactions between the human microbiome and
computers. The result is a series of works which attempt to establish a visual
communication system, using computer vision to seed a computer program, the
ambition was to not capture bacteria as a lifelike visual representation, but
to portray the essence of their behaviours as understood and drawn by the
machine. These experiments portray this concept in early stages of development,
as a proof of concept, with a strong focus on the philosophical underpinnings
to be applied within potential future works. They aim to explore ways of
machine seeing in the microbiome, and the potentials for bacterial processes to
become a part of an artistic digital ecology. Here the experiments are
embedded, for each pair, the original bacteria appear on the left and the
computational ‘translation’ on the right.
