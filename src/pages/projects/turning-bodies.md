This piece explores the concept of flow, from motion phenomenas in the natural
world to the enhanced state of mind found in creative tasks and meaningful
work. Flow is often described as a heightened state of being where time may
either pass more quickly or more slowly than usual, yet is focused, intense,
intentional, productive and satisfying. In nature, from the flowing of bodies
of water to the motion embodied by an ant colony, it seems to have the same
qualities and upon observation fosters meditative experiences. The work
utilises flow fields and a group of animated bezier curves which are smoothly
directed across the canvas.
