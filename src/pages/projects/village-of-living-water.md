This piece aims to explore symbiotic relationships found in nature, as well as
trickle down effects and emergent properties of ecologies. The piece is
inspired by the small village of Harie in Japan, where spring water flows into
the town from the mountains. The residents each have a shed outdoors in which
they wash vegetables and clean plates. Koi in these sheds eat the scraps and
purify the water which then runs down onto the rice crops. This village,
nicknamed “The Village of Living Water” symbolises a very special relationship
that humans have with nature, and water in particular, as it is a very rare and
endangered practice which we could all learn from. I wanted to explore our
relationship with water in a tactile way, by using water as an input method to
Max, and seeding various events within the computer program with the live data.
