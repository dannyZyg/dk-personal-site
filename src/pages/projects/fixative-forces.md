---

Fixative Forces explores forces of pull and attraction through interactions
between virtual shapes and a body translated onto the canvas. In four different
modes, the program creates varying behaviours for these shapes as they are
pulled into certain points on the bodyâ€™s outline, or are impacted by new forces
created by optical flow data.
