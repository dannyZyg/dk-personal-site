Nexus aims to explore the link between ecologies, networks and emergence, as
portrayed through computation. It is an examination of the Biophilia Hypothesis
which suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to connect with nature
and with other forms of life.

Three individual environments live and grow, each with unique rules for their
inhabitants. When certain conditions are met, an environment may establish a
connection with another, impacting the destination systemâ€™s fundamental
workings. The three systems are codependent, and together they are self
efficient, however, one can seed the processes and communicate with the systems
by bringing a hand close to the light interface.

Utilising physical geometry, these environments and their communications are
projection mapped onto the surfaces and are brought into the real world for us
to observe up close. Communications between systems and the user sprout up as
if finding a path along stepping stones.
