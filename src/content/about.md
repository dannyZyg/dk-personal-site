Danny Keig is an artist, musician and software engineer working with code.

His two main areas of exploration are:
- __Unpacking the natural world__: Appreciation and preservation of processes found in the natural world

- __Securing the digital world__: Critique and undoing of the current mode of surveillance capitalism

With a deep background in audio, his current focus is on revisiting sound
creation and processing through computer programming - whether that be utilising data
sonification, generative and algorithmic composition or live coding.

He approaches hardware and software with curiosity and awe while maintaining
skepticism and awareness of its blindspots. Danny investigates uses for technologies which sit outside
of their intended purpose - to arrive at creative conclusions from data,
algorithms and computational processes.

His work has been exhibited blah blah...
