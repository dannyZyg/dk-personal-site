I make things with software - whether that be art and music or tools and applications.

My background is in music and audio engineering. I've spent the last decade
trying to get closer to the machine in my creative pursuits - the logical
conclusion was programming. Along the way I discovered the joys of automation
too.

I am passionate about linux, neovim... in fact all free and open source software.

I have started [writing](https://www.s1t2.com.au/blog/experiential/interactive-audio-future) about my experience and I plan to do this more and more!
